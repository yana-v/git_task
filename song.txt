I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it the apocalypse

I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
I'm radioactive
Radioactive
I'm radioactive
Radioactive

I raise my flag and don my clothes
It's a revolution I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
I'm breaking in and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse

I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
I'm radioactive
Radioactive
I'm radioactive
Radioactive

All systems go
Sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones
Straight from inside

I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
I'm radioactive
Radioactive
I'm radioactive
Radioactive
